Remove small or broken pieces to prevent any potential choking hazard. Please be mindful of your pet's age, health, and current diet conditions when selecting products. Please note, our Best Bully Sticks Beef Bully Sticks are rich in protein; If bully sticks are a new treat for your dog, we recommend only letting your dog chew about 1 stick at a time to avoid tummy upset due to the increased protein. After they have enjoyed about 3 to 5 sticks over a 3-5 day period, their tummy should be familiar with the increased protein and you can safely treat at your discretion! Please note that beef bully sticks are considered a treat\/chew and should not make up more than 10% of the daily caloric intake. Please note that our dog treats & chews are NOT for human consumption.<\/p>",
